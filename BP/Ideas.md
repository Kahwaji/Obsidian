Ideas to submit:
- Build a similar tool to Salesforce Inspector
- Update field without the need to update the name in its references. the system should do it automotically
- CAtegorise System types proberly and add filters, Update/ Edit is not working. It creates a new one instead of Update. 

- Add IsChanged function
- Update Workflow to be able to updated multi fields in one Workflow action (similar to SF)
- When change the name of a referenced field, BP should automotacaly change the reference name in the referenced field without raiseing an error and ask the suer to change the referenced field manually.
- Make the Date formt change configurbale in the System: example: change the  date format from OOTB (MM-DD-YYYY) to Eurpenuance style (DD-MM-YYYY)
- When creating a bulk loader, when upload a template, the system should try to auto mapp the fields first to save us some time.
